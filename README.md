#### Learning CSS one styling criterion at a time

#### What is this?
This project is built to explore various criteria for styling a React front end.
It will cover the following criteria (updated over time)
1. positioning elements with:
  a. CSS Flexbox
  b. CSS Grid
2. (to be determined)

#### Of note:
1. Initially, styling is done using the `css-in-js` pattern. The `styled-components` `npm` package is used to achieve this.
